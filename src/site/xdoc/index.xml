  <subsection name="What is MyBatis-CDI?">
      <p>
      MyBatis-CDI extension takes care of the lifecycle of MyBatis mappers and <code>SqlSession</code>s. MyBatis components
      are directly injected into your CDI beans ready to be used,  there is no need to create or destroy them.
      It also provides local and JTA transaction support based on the <code>@Transactional</code> annotation.
      </p>
  </subsection>

  <subsection name="Requirements">
    <p>
      Before starting with MyBatis-CDI integration, it is very important
      that you are familiar with both MyBatis and CDI terminology. This
      document does not attempt to provide background information or basic
      setup and configuration tutorials for either MyBatis or CDI.
    </p>
    <p>
      MyBatis-CDI requires Java EE 6 or higher and any MyBatis version.
    </p>
